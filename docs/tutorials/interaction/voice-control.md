# Voice Control Tutorial

Learn how to use voice commands for hands-free interaction with CatGo.

## Overview

CatGo supports voice input via Whisper (local speech-to-text) and voice output via text-to-speech, enabling conversational interaction.

## Step 1: Enable Voice

Open the Gesture Settings pane and enable voice input. Select your microphone.

## Step 2: Speech-to-Text Setup

### Whisper Engine

CatGo uses a local Whisper model for privacy-preserving speech recognition. The model is downloaded on first use.

## Step 3: Voice Commands

### Structure Commands

- "Rotate left/right/up/down"
- "Zoom in/out"
- "Reset view"
- "Show bonds/labels/axes"

### Atom Art

- "Place a carbon atom"
- "Add oxygen here"
- "Build a benzene ring"

### Analysis Commands

- "Compute RDF"
- "Show band structure"
- "Optimize structure"

## Step 4: Text-to-Speech Response

CatGo responds with voice feedback for executed commands.

## Step 5: Customize

Adjust voice activation sensitivity, language, and TTS voice in settings.
