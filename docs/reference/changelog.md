# Changelog

All notable changes to CatGo are documented here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Plugin system (Phase 0–5) — server-side plugin architecture with lifecycle management, dependency resolution, sandboxed execution, SFTP fallback, and frontend integration
- ABACUS input file export (INPUT, STRU, KPT) from structure viewer
- Force field conversion via Open Babel (GAFF, GAFF2, OPLS-AA) with CLI fallback
- Bond drag-to-connect — click and drag between atoms to create bonds with a real-time ghost bond preview
- Per-atom charge labels — right-click atom to toggle, drag to reposition, double-click to edit value
- Bulk show/hide all charge labels via context menu
- Manual charge value entry for atoms without Bader data
- Charge labels auto-hide when switching away from charge coloring mode and reappear when switching back
- Gaussian CUBE file visualization with isosurface rendering and 2D slice planes
- Materials Project API integration with band gap, energy, and stability data
- Paste structure content feature (Ctrl+Enter to import)
- Vacuum Box as standalone modal with ghost toolbar buttons
- `wrap_molecule_in_box` for non-periodic structures
- Depth cueing (fog effect) for visual depth perception
- Bond editing mode with add/delete functionality
- Atom drag UX: hold Shift+Alt to drag without clicking

### Changed
- Depth cueing on bonds now fades toward the background color (VESTA-style) instead of just darkening
- Removed depth cueing slider from controls panel (setting still works via config)

### Fixed
- AtomLegend × toggle visibility only working once (Svelte 5 `$derived.by()` Set tracking issue)
- Trajectory files (xyz.gz, traj, h5) from CatGo Database sidebar failing to load — binary files now handled properly via `load_from_url`
- Bond hitbox sensitivity reduced to prevent accidental selection when creating bonds
- Bond selection hit detection and deletion
- Scroll wheel rotation, supercell alignment, and context menu errors
- Slab cutter Y-axis flip from left-handed lattice
- Camera alignment with lattice after slab cut and supercell operations
- Right-handed lattice enforcement after slab generation
- TrackballControls camera snap-back during Ctrl key press
- Measurement lines follow atom positions during drag/rotate
- Bonds display correctly after rotation
- Camera recentering prevented during atom manipulation
- Index-keyed maps cleared when atom count changes to prevent snap-back
- Pencil mode ghost fix after slab cut
